Every work day for the past year and a half has started in about the same way. Wake up. Take a shower. Get Dressed. Drive to the next town over for my job. Before I get to the school, I have something of a morning ritual. I go into this convenience store about half a mile from my work. I always get the same thing--sausage biscuit, 32 ounce drink. $4.01 later, I'm on my way to work again!

See, $4.01 doesn't seem like a large chunk of change at face value. Let's take another angle, though. 28.07 per week, around $121.64 a month, $1463.65 per year (given I eat this every day). Let's be a little more realistic with this. My contract is for 185 days per school year. On top of this, I do about 12 extra Saturdays per year. 197 days per year... That's $789.97 per year on breakfast. Here's something I used to eat a lot as a kid at home. 30 seconds and down the hatch.

    * American Cheese (Store Brand) - $2.48 per pack / about 10 cents per day
    * Honey Ham (Store Brand)       - $3.56 per pack / about 80 cents per serving
    * Croissant (Store Brand)       - $3.98 per pack / about 33 cents per day

I could eat this instead for $1.23 every day. $242.31 per contract term (197 days with the additional Saturdays). 

Another frugal option would be Oatmeal. $5.49 for 30 servings. 18 cents per day, $36 per school year. It's much cheaper, but don't try to compromise with yourself *too* much. Make a smaller change first, then push for more change bit by bit. You might decide that if I go to FiveStar for my sausage biscuit, that'll save you 50 cents per day. 

How about the Jimmy Dean Sausage, Egg, and Cheese croissant. These are 10.97 for a pack of 8, or $1.37 per day. This is still much cheaper. Why not go this route, then? For one, I think these taste like cardboard. For two, this takes about three minutes. I am not a morning person, and I tend to get in a hurry in the morning. If I went this route I would be back to $4.01 breakfast in about two days. 

I've been interested in early retirement for a while now, but somewhere along the line I fell off the train and started spending more and more. Another angle of approaching this mentally is realizing that just breaking this habit will shave $13,543 off of my FIRE Number. 

This month has been a fairly frugal one for me. I'm commiting to save more money, and slash my expenses. In total I've cut my entertainment budget by 75%, fuel costs by half (though I could do better if I could convince myself to part with the truck), almost cut my auto insurance in half, and cancelled a number of subscriptions. Here's a list of things I cut: 
* ChatGPT. ChatGPT has been a huge quality of life improvement. It's costing about $21.20 per month, though. Google Bard is comparable, and it's free!
* Streaming Services. 
* Amazon Prime. I'd rather go to the store to get what I need. That little bit of extra friction helps me save money. If it's not in store, online shopping is okay. When shopping online I donot save my debit card information on any sites. I'm lazy. If my wallet is across the room, I'm pretty unlikely to walk over there to buy something. 
* I ditched the credit cards. I'm not really financially responsible enough to have them. Some people think Dave Ramsey is crazy for this, and I did, too. All of a sudden, I found myself in a bunch of debt. Maybe I'll write about how I feel about credit cards eventually.
